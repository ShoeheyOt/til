# Code should be easy to understand

## Key Idea
### "Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand."
- "understand" here means literally fully understand and someone else should be able to make changes to it, spot bugs, and understand how it interacts with the rest of your code.
- someone else could be future you.

### Generally speaking, the less code you wtite, the better for readers to understand.
- but the more importnat thing is to minimize the time of readers to understand the codes, so more lines might be better.

### Time-till-understanding doesn't conflict other goals
- making the code easy to understand often leads to code that is well architected and easy to test.
- it is always important to step back and re-think "is the code easy to understand?" if so, you can move on to the next one.
