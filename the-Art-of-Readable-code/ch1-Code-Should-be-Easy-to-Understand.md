# Code should be easy to understand

## Key Idea
"Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand."
- "understand" here means literally fully understand and someone else should be able to make changes to it, spot bugs, and understand how it interacts with the rest of your code.
- someone else could be future you.
- it is important to think back always that "is this code easy to understan?" if so, you can move on to other codes
